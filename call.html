	<p>
	  The International Conference on Compiler Construction (CC) is interested in work on processing programs in the most general sense: analyzing, transforming or executing input that describes how a system operates, including traditional compiler construction as a special case.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Original contributions are solicited on the topics of interest which include, but are not limited to:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Compilation and interpretation techniques, including program representation, analysis, and transformation; code generation, optimization, and synthesis; the verification thereof
            </li>
            <li>
              Run-time techniques, including memory management, virtual machines, and dynamic and just-in-time compilation
            </li>
            <li>
              Programming tools, including refactoring editors, checkers, verifiers, compilers, debuggers, and profilers
            </li>
            <li>
              Techniques for specific domains, such as secure, parallel, distributed, embedded or mobile environments
            </li>
            <li>
              Design and implementation of novel language constructs, programming models, and domain-specific languages
            </li>
          </ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	  CC 2019 is the 28th edition of the conference. It will be co-located with CGO, HPCA, and PPoPP and take place during 16-17 February in Washington, DC, USA.
