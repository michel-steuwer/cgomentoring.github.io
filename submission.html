<h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2> 

<p>
Please make sure that your paper satisfies <strong>ALL</strong> of the following requirements before it is submitted:</p> 

<ul>
<li>The paper must be original material that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings.</li> 
<li>
  Papers must be written in English using 10pt font size.
  Both regular papers (up to 11 pages, not including references) and tool papers (up to 5 pages, not including references) are invited. In tool papers, the first part (2 pages) should describe the tool and the second part (about 3 pages) explain the contents of the demo that will be presented with examples and screenshots. We highly recommend  the <a href=http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template>templates</a> provided by SIGPLAN.
      Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chair(s). (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on 8.5"x11" paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.)
</li> 
<li>
	  Submissions must adhere strictly to the page limits including figures or appendices. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. Page limits <em>do not</em> include references. Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version (listings, data, proofs) may be included in a clearly marked appendix. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not be submitted for publication elsewhere. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation.
</li>
<li>
  Papers are to be submitted for <strong><em>double-blind review</em></strong>. Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside 
reviewers. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., John.Martin.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending someone else's research. We realize in doing this that for some papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission will not be penalized as long a concerted effort was made to reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were extending someone else's research. For example, if your name is John Martin:</li> 
</ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In previous work [1,2], Martin presented a new register allocator for .... In this paper, we extend his work by ...</p> 
<p>Bibliography<br> 
[1] John Martin, "A Register Allocator for ...," CC '10.<br> 
[2] John Martin, "A Generalized Register Allocator for ...," CC '11.</p> 
</blockquote> 

<ul> 
<li>Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper.</li> 
<li>Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small.</li> 
<li>
	  For LaTeX users, in particular, please use the conference format described in sample-sigplan.tex to format your papers:
	  <pre>\documentclass[sigplan, anonymous, review]{acmart}</pre>
	  The "sigplan" option selects the proceedings format for SIGPLAN conferences, using the default 10pt font size.
	  The "anonymous" option is used for double-blind reviewing.
	  In addition, you are also recommended but not required to use the "review" option, which adds line numbers on the side, thereby allowing reviewers to refer to specific lines in their comments.
</li>
<li>The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol.</li> 
<li>Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER size paper. If generating the paper using "dvips", use the option "-P cmz -t letter", and if that is not supported, use 
"-t letter".</li> 
</ul> </div>
